        <div class="grid-item">“Every morning, I start my day with a cup of chai. It’s part of my routine—it reminds me of home, of family.”</div>
    
        <div class="grid-item">“I take 10 minutes every morning to meditate. It’s my way of grounding myself before stepping out into the city.”</div>
    
        <div class="grid-item">“Before bed, I always read a chapter of a book. It’s the only time I can really zone out and just focus on myself.”</div>
    
        <div class="grid-item">“I always call my mom before bed. It’s a way to stay connected, even though she’s far away.”</div>
    
        <div class="grid-item">“When I feel stressed, I take a walk in the park. It’s my place to clear my head and reconnect with myself.”</div>
    
        <div class="grid-item">“I light a candle before I study or work. It helps me feel like I’m creating a space of peace around me.”</div>
