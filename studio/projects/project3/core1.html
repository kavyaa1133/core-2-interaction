        <div class="grid-item">“A scarf my mom gave me. It’s soft and smells like home, and when I wrap it around me, I feel connected to her, even though we're thousands of miles apart.”</div>
        
        <div class="grid-item">“I keep a locket with a picture of my little sister. She’s my grounding force. No matter where I am, I can always find her smile.”</div>

        <div class="grid-item">“I carry a tiny stone from the beach near my childhood home. I keep it in my pocket, and whenever I hold it, I feel grounded, like I’m still connected to that place.”</div>

        <div class="grid-item">“I have a voice memo saved from my dad telling me he’s proud of me. On tough days, I play it quietly through my headphones, and it reminds me to keep going.”</div>

        <div class="grid-item">“I keep a tiny dried flower pressed inside my journal. My friend gave it to me the day I moved to the city;it reminds me I’m loved, no matter how far I go.”</div>
