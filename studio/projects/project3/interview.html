      <p class="speaker">Interviewer:</p>
      <p>Hi! Okay, so this is part of my project - I am building a website called <em>Everyday Shields for Women</em>, and it’s kind of like a gentle space for us to share the small things we carry or do that make us feel safe and held, especially as women in the city. So… wanna start with: what’s one thing in your bag that gives you comfort?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewee:</p>
      <p>Oh, um... honestly? My birdie safety alarm. And I hate that that’s the first thing I think of. But yeah, it’s always there, it’s kind of muscle memory at this point, like phone, wallet, keys... birdie safety alarm. In terms of emotionally, my grandmom also gave me this tiny coin purse before I moved here. It’s not even that useful, but I keep it in my bag anyway. It smells like home and makes me feel safe.</p>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewer:</p>
      <p>I totally get that - Do you have a tiny ritual that helps you feel grounded?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewee:</p>
      <p>Yeah, making warm chai or a turmeric ginger tea with way too much honey. Only when I’ve had a shitty day. That’s how I know it’s like, “I need to take care of myself” time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewer:</p>
      <p>I love that - like a little alert to check in with yourself. What about a home remedy or something your mom or family passed on?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewee:</p>
      <p>Turmeric milk. I hated it growing up, and now I make it every time I feel even slightly sick or overwhelmed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewer:</p>
      <p>Yes!! Okay, last one - has there been a time when your intuition protected you?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <p class="speaker">Interviewee:</p>
      <p>Hmm… yeah. I was walking back from the subway late last fall, and I remember this guy was walking behind me, and everything looked normal, but something just felt off. So I ducked into a deli and just waited. And he waited too. The deli guy noticed and walked out to check. That moment stuck with me - not just that I trusted my gut, but that someone else saw it too. I felt scared, but also like... I had some support. You know?</p>
