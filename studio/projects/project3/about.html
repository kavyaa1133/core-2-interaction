    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>Everyday Shields is a living archive of care — a collection of small rituals, objects, and stories that young women carry with them as they navigate city life.</p>

    <p>From real conversations and shared experiences, this website gathers emotional carriers, physical items, grounding rituals, and personal stories — both light and heavy — that act as invisible shields against the noise, unpredictability, and vulnerabilities of urban life.</p>

    <p>Inspired by years of working with communities that empower women, Everyday Shields is built for daughters, sisters, friends — especially those living far from home, finding ways to root themselves in new cities. It's a gentle reminder that safety, comfort, and resilience aren't always loud — often, they live in the quietest, most personal things we hold close.</p>

    <p>Join us in building a collection of care that speaks to the everyday ways women protect and nurture themselves in the hustle and heart of the city.</p>
